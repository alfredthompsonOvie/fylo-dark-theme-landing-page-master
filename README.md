## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I realized, I have a lot to learn about html5, flexbox and css grid.

### Continued development

In the future i want to be proficient in css layouts (css grid and flex box), during the course of this project i got to better understand background images, their sizing as well as their positioning. I still have a long way to go but am really happy with the progress.

I am also glad that I am getting more comfortable with flexbox.

It is always fun to work with both grid and flex layouts.

### Useful resources

-   [Telusko | Form Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeIRHETbcLs) - This helped me learn how to write regular expression in Javascript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
